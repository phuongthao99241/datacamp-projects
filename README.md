# datacamp-projects
Welcome to my Git! 
This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed as part of my learning journey on DataCamp. 
Each project demonstrates my proficiency in different areas of data analytics, including data manipulation, visualization, modeling, and interpretation. 
The projects were completed using various tools and programming languages such as Python, SQL,.... 
In each project, I have applied my skills to real-world datasets and provided detailed documentation of my analysis, thought process, and conclusions. 
I hope that these projects will demonstrate my skills and passion for data analytics and provide insights into my approach to problem-solving. 
Thank you for taking the time to explore my work!
